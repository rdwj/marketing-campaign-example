## Photo Requirements Per Listing

### Premium/Rare Items (5+ photos)
1. Front full view
2. Back full view
3. Hang tag front (close-up)
4. Hang tag inside (generation info)
5. Tush tag close-up
6. Any unique features (errors, special markings)
7. Scale reference (ruler or quarter)

### Bundles (3-5 photos)
1. Group shot - all items arranged attractively
2. Highlight shot - 2-3 best pieces close-up
3. Tag sample - show one set of tags
4. Layout shot - items spread out to see all

### Bulk Lots (2-3 photos)
1. Full pile/group shot
2. Spread out view showing variety
3. Sample condition shot

## Lighting Setup

### Natural Light (Best for beginners)
- Shoot near a window with indirect light
- Avoid direct sunlight (creates harsh shadows)
- Best times: overcast days or north-facing windows
- Use white poster board to bounce light

### Artificial Light
- Position light at 45-degree angle to subject
- Use diffuser or bounce off white surface
- Avoid mixing natural and artificial light
- Consistent lighting = consistent photos

## Background Standards

### Primary: Clean White
- White poster board or foam board
- Creates professional, cohesive look
- Etsy buyers expect clean backgrounds
- Makes colors pop

### Acceptable Alternatives
- Light wood surface (for "lifestyle" feel)
- Soft gray backdrop
- Light blue for ocean-themed bundles

### Never Use
- Busy patterns
- Dark backgrounds
- Messy rooms visible
- Beds, carpets, floors

## Composition Guidelines

### The Rule of Thirds
- Don't center everything
- Place subject slightly off-center
- Leave some breathing room around edges

### Individual Items
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│    ┌─────┐          │
│    │     │          │
│    │ BB  │          │
│    │     │          │
│    └─────┘          │
│          [ruler]    │
└─────────────────────┘
```

### Bundles - Pyramid/Arc
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│      ○   ○          │
│    ○   ○   ○        │
│  ○   ○   ○   ○      │
└─────────────────────┘
```

### Flat Lay (for bundles)
- Arrange in a grid or organic scatter
- Ensure all items are visible
- Vary orientations slightly for visual interest

## Camera Settings

### Smartphone Tips
- Clean your lens (seriously, do this every time)
- Tap to focus on the Beanie Baby, not background
- Avoid zoom - move closer instead
- Use portrait mode for single items (blurred background)
- Take 3-5 shots and pick the best

### Technical Settings (if available)
- ISO: Low (100-400) to reduce grain
- Avoid flash (creates harsh shadows)
- If editing: slightly increase brightness and contrast

## Photographing Tags

### Hang Tags
- Critical for collectors - must be readable
- Photograph flat, not at angle
- Show both outside (heart) and inside (generation)
- Ensure text is in focus

### Tush Tags
- Fold Beanie to expose tag clearly
- Get close enough to read all text
- Include both sides if there's printing

### Tag Condition Documentation
- If tags have creases, show them
- Photograph any protectors if attached
- Honesty prevents returns

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Lighting Issues
- Too dark (underexposed)
- Harsh shadows from direct flash/sun
- Yellow tint from indoor lighting

### Focus Issues
- Blurry main subject
- Tags unreadable
- Background in focus, subject blurry

### Composition Issues
- Cutting off edges of Beanie
- Messy background visible
- Too much empty space
- Items overlapping too much (can't see individuals)

### Condition Honesty
- Don't photograph only the "good side"
- If there's a flaw, photograph it
- Better to disclose than get returns

## Photo Editing (Quick Fixes)

### Recommended Apps (Free)
- Snapseed (iOS/Android)
- VSCO (iOS/Android)
- Lightroom Mobile (free tier)

### Quick Edit Checklist
1. Crop to remove excess background
2. Increase brightness slightly (+10-15%)
3. Increase contrast slightly (+5-10%)
4. Check white balance (should look neutral)
5. Don't over-filter - keep colors true

### Do Not
- Over-saturate colors
- Apply heavy filters
- Blur imperfections dishonestly
- Make colors look different than reality

## Photo File Naming

Use consistent naming for organization:

```
[name]-[type]-[number].jpg

cubbie-front-01.jpg
cubbie-tag-02.jpg
bundle-bears-group-01.jpg
bundle-bears-detail-02.jpg
lot-50-overview-01.jpg
```

## Batch Photography Workflow

For 1,543 Beanie Babies, efficiency matters:

### Session Setup
1. Set up lighting and backdrop once
2. Place ruler in consistent position
3. Keep camera/phone in fixed position (tripod helps)
4. Shoot in batches of 20-30

### Per-Item Flow (30-60 seconds each)
1. Place Beanie Baby
2. Take front shot
3. Flip for back shot
4. Quick tag shots
5. Move to next

### Bundle Batching
1. Pre-arrange 5 bundles
2. Photograph all in sequence
3. Rearrange and repeat

### Weekly Goal
- 50-100 items photographed per session
- 2-3 sessions per week during setup phase
- Don't try to do everything at once

## Storing Photos

- Create folder structure matching inventory
- Back up to cloud (Google Photos, iCloud)
- Keep originals even after editing
- Delete obvious bad shots to save space
