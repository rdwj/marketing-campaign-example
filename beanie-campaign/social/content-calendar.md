# Social Media Content Plan

## Platform Strategy

### Primary: Instagram
- Visual platform suits product photos
- Nostalgia content performs well
- Reels can go viral
- Link in bio to Etsy shop

### Secondary: TikTok
- Highest viral potential
- "90s kid" content resonates
- Day-in-the-life selling content popular
- Younger audience but nostalgic for 90s (ironic appreciation)

### Optional: Facebook
- Beanie Baby collector groups exist
- Good for driving traffic
- Older demographic (actual 90s collectors)
