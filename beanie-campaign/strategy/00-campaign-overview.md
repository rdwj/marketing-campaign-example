## Strategic Approach

### The Honest Nostalgia Play

We're not pretending these are investments. We're selling:
- **Childhood memories** to millennials
- **Vintage 90s aesthetic** to collectors
- **Affordable gifts** to parents
- **Craft supplies** to makers

### Three-Tier System

1. **Premium Listings** - Individual rare pieces, full documentation
2. **Themed Bundles** - 5-10 pieces grouped by theme ($15-40)
3. **Bulk Lots** - 20-50 pieces for resellers/crafters

## Campaign Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
- Complete inventory with photos
- Research sold prices for all 5 rare pieces
- Create Etsy shop with optimized branding
- List first 10 premium items

### Phase 2: Ramp-Up (Weeks 5-12)
- Launch themed bundles (2-3 per week)
- Run Etsy Ads on premium items ($50/month budget)
- Cross-post to Instagram/TikTok for visibility

### Phase 3: Momentum (Weeks 13-20)
- Holiday push (if applicable)
- Flash sales on slow-moving bundles
- Introduce larger bulk lots

### Phase 4: Liquidation (Weeks 21-26)
- 30-50% markdowns on remaining inventory
- "Everything must go" messaging
- Final mega-lots at steep discounts
- Consider donation for tax write-off on remainder

## Key Success Metrics

- **Listings Active:** Target 150-200 at any time
- **Conversion Rate:** Etsy average is 1-3%, aim for 2%+
- **Average Order Value:** Target $25+ (bundles help)
- **Sell-Through Rate:** 90%+ by month 6

## Campaign Documents

| Document | Location | Purpose |

| Listing Templates | `templates/` | Copy for each tier |
| SEO Guide | `guides/seo-keywords.md` | Search optimization |

## Budget

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Etsy Listing Fees | $0.20/listing × 200 = $40 |
| Etsy Ads (optional) | $50/month × 4 = $200 |
| Shipping Supplies | $100 |
| Photography Setup | $0-50 (use phone + white poster board) |
| **Total Investment** | **$200-400** |

## Risk Factors

1. **Market saturation** - Lots of Beanie Baby sellers; differentiate with bundles and tone
2. **Shipping costs** - Can eat into margins; offer calculated shipping
3. **Time investment** - Photography and listing is labor-intensive
4. **Emotional attachment** - Already addressed; seller is ready

## Exit Strategy

If sell-through is below 50% by month 5:
- Aggressive bulk pricing ($0.25/piece in 100-lots)
- Donate remainder for tax deduction
- Consider local consignment/estate sale venues
