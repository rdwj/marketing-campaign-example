# Brand Voice & Messaging Guidelines

## Shop Name Options

Pick one that signals self-awareness and nostalgia:

- **The Beanie Reckoning** (humorous acknowledgment)
- **90s Kids Beanie Co.** (nostalgia-forward)
- **Beanie Time Capsule** (vintage angle)
- **Honest Beanie Shop** (straightforward)

## Brand Personality

### We Are:
- **Self-aware** - We know the bubble burst
- **Nostalgic** - But we genuinely love these little guys
- **Honest** - No inflated claims about value
- **Warm** - Friendly, approachable, millennial-coded

### We Are Not:
- Pretending these are investments
- Using aggressive sales tactics
- Overselling condition or rarity
- Taking ourselves too seriously

## Voice Examples

### Good (On-Brand)

> "Look, we all thought we'd retire on these. We didn't. But they're still adorable, and your inner 8-year-old deserves closure. Mint tags, authentic 90s vibes, priced for reality."

> "This is Patti the Platypus. She was going to pay for college. Now she'd just like a nice home where someone appreciates her weird little beak."

> "Cleaning out the vault. 1,500+ Beanie Babies need new homes. No haggling, fair prices, and yes—we accept that we're not millionaires."

### Bad (Off-Brand)

> "RARE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY! This Beanie Baby could be worth THOUSANDS!"

> "Serious collectors only. No lowballers."

> "Vintage collectible, priced to reflect TRUE VALUE."

## Messaging by Context

### Shop Banner/About Section

> **The Great Beanie Baby Reckoning**
>
> Once upon a time in the 90s, we believed. Tag protectors. Ty newsletters. Display cases. The works.
>
> The millions never came, but these little guys are still here—mint condition, looking for new adventures. We're pricing them honestly and shipping them with love.
>
> Whether you're reclaiming your childhood, starting a collection for your kids, or need craft supplies that spark joy—welcome.

### Listing Descriptions (Tone Guide)

**For Rare/Premium Items:**
Professional but warm. Include all technical details (tag generation, pellet type, errors) but don't oversell.

**For Bundles:**
Playful and nostalgic. Lean into themes and memories.

**For Bulk Lots:**
Practical and straightforward. Appeal to resellers and crafters.

## Responding to Messages

### Price Negotiation
> "Thanks for reaching out! Our prices are set to be fair from the start, so we don't do individual negotiations. But keep an eye on our shop—we run bundle deals and sales as we go."

### Authenticity Questions
> "All our Beanie Babies are authentic Ty products from the original 90s production. Happy to send additional photos of tags or any specific details you'd like to see."

### Shipping Questions
> "We ship within 2 business days. Each Beanie is wrapped in tissue paper and shipped in a box (not envelope) to protect those precious tags."

## Social Media Voice

Same warmth and self-awareness, but shorter and punchier:

> "Day 47 of the great destash. 1,412 to go. Today's featured friend: Claude the Crab. He has no regrets."

> "POV: It's 1998 and you're convinced this $5 bear will fund your retirement"

> "Swipe to see 27 bears who were supposed to make us rich → They're all available, link in bio"
