# Pricing Matrix

## Research Method

Before pricing anything:
1. Search eBay for the specific Beanie Baby
2. Filter to **SOLD** listings (not active listings)
3. Look at the last 10-20 sales
4. Price at the median of sold prices

**Never trust Etsy/eBay asking prices.** Only sold prices reflect reality.

## Tier 1: Premium/Rare Items (5 pieces)

### Criteria for Premium Tier
- Verified rare variants (tag errors, limited editions)
- Princess Diana bear (certain versions)
- 1st generation hang tags + 1st generation tush tags
- eBay sold history showing $50+ sales

### Pricing Strategy
| Market Sold Price | Your Price | Rationale |
|-------------------|------------|-----------|
| $50-100 | 90% of median | Competitive, quick sale |
| $100-250 | 85% of median | Faster turnover |
| $250+ | 80% of median | These attract attention |

### Premium Listing Fees
- Consider Etsy Ads ($0.50-2/day per listing)
- Etsy takes 6.5% transaction fee + 3% payment processing

### Example Pricing
| Item | eBay Sold Median | Your Etsy Price |
|------|------------------|-----------------|
| Princess Diana Bear (1st ed) | $300 | $249 |
| Rare tag error | $75 | $65 |
| 1st gen Patti | $40 | $35 |

## Tier 2: Themed Bundles

### Bundle Construction
| Bundle Size | Price Point | Per-Piece Value |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 5 pieces | $15-20 | $3-4 each |
| 8 pieces | $25-30 | $3-3.75 each |
| 10 pieces | $30-40 | $3-4 each |

### Suggested Bundles
| Theme | Contents | Price |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Bears Only | 8 assorted bears | $28 |
| Ocean Friends | 5 sea creatures | $18 |
| Farm Animals | 6 farm animals | $22 |
| Cats Collection | 5 cats | $18 |
| Dogs Collection | 6 dogs | $22 |
| Rainbow Bundle | 8 different colors | $28 |
| Birthday Bundle | 5 + tissue + ribbon | $25 |
| 90s Starter Pack | 10 iconic 90s picks | $35 |

### Bundle Pricing Logic
- Bundles should feel like a "deal" vs buying individually
- But you're moving volume, so lower per-unit is fine
- Include popular + less popular pieces together

## Tier 3: Bulk Lots

### Target Buyers
- Resellers looking for inventory
- Crafters (stuffing, fabric projects)
- Daycares, schools
- Party planners

### Bulk Pricing
| Lot Size | Price | Per-Piece |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| 20 pieces | $15 | $0.75 |
| 50 pieces | $30 | $0.60 |
| 100 pieces | $50 | $0.50 |
| 250 pieces | $100 | $0.40 |

### Bulk Lot Notes
- Bulk lots = "mystery" or "random" selection
- Include condition note: "May include minor wear, no major defects"
- Great way to clear inventory fast in months 5-6

## Shipping Pricing

### Options
1. **Calculated Shipping** - Etsy calculates based on buyer location
   - Pro: You never lose money
   - Con: Higher visible prices can deter buyers

2. **Flat Rate**
   - 1-3 Beanies: $5
   - 4-10 Beanies: $8
   - 11+ Beanies: $12
   - Bulk lots: $15-20

3. **Free Shipping** (built into price)
   - Pro: Better search placement on Etsy
   - Con: Eat into margins
   - Best for: Premium items where you have margin

### Recommended Approach
- Premium items: Free shipping (built in)
- Bundles: Flat rate $5-8
- Bulk lots: Calculated shipping (heavy)

## Price Reduction Schedule

| Timeline | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Weeks 1-12 | Full price |
| Weeks 13-16 | 15% off slow movers |
| Weeks 17-20 | 25% off + larger bundles |
| Weeks 21-24 | 40% off + mega bulk lots |
| Week 25-26 | "Make an offer" on everything |

## Break-Even Analysis

### Per-Item Costs
| Cost | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Etsy listing fee | $0.20 |
| Etsy transaction fee | 6.5% of sale |
| Payment processing | 3% + $0.25 |
| Shipping supplies | ~$0.50/item |

### Example: $20 Bundle (8 pieces)
| | Amount |
|---|--------|
| Sale price | $20.00 |
| Listing fee | -$0.20 |
| Transaction fee (6.5%) | -$1.30 |
| Payment processing | -$0.85 |
| Shipping supplies | -$1.00 |
| **Net before shipping** | **$16.65** |

If shipping is $5 flat and actual cost is $6, you net $15.65 on a $25 order.

## Price Floor

Never sell below these minimums (not worth the effort):

| Type | Minimum |
|------|---------|
| Individual listing | $8 |
| Bundle | $15 |
| Bulk lot | $0.40/piece |
