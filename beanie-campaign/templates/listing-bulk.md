## Pro Tips for Bulk Lots

1. **Be honest about condition** - Undersell slightly; happy buyers leave reviews
2. **Calculate shipping carefully** - Bulk is heavy; don't lose money on shipping
3. **Photograph representative sample** - Don't cherry-pick best pieces for photo
4. **Offer volume discounts** - Incentivize buying multiple lots
5. **Consider local pickup** - Large lots can save on shipping if buyer is nearby
6. **Bundle shipping** - "Buy 2 lots, free shipping" moves more inventory
